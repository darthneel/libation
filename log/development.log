- Not too over the top and not too simple either. Nice for catching up with a friend
 or a fun cocktail party. -Emil Gampe, Launch My Line
- A swank cocktail den in the heart of the city with a cocktail menu by Julie Reiner
 that includes fresh fruit & top-notch spices & spirits in original drinks like the
 Lilikoi & the Hibiscus Swizzle.
- Congratulations, you''ve found one of Esquire''s Best Bars in America. Go for the
 cocktails -- we like the manhattan. They''re some of the very best in the country.
- Go to Flatiron Lounge and reserve the downstairs room for a large group.
- If you want a table to enjoy your deliciously and expertly made cocktails, make
 reservations ahead of time. We love the Beijing Peach and the Dark & Stormy.
- It evokes the Prohibition-era vibe Manhattanites are so fond of, while (thanks to
 fab cocktails) still remaining true to a hip & trendy drinking scene. We love how
 eclectic the crowds are as a result.
- don''t get offended when they give you a glass of water. you just might need it.
- Had 1 too many!
- Great place for that 3rd date or if you have a friend who just got laid off and
 needs a cocktail. Vodka and cucumber lovers - get the Miss Lynn.

- This subterranean spot''s only marked by a small plaque & doorbell you must ring
 to be admitted. Inside you''ll find perfectly prepared, fresh-juiced, hand-stirred
 or shaken classic cocktails & punches.
- There is no better scotch cocktail than the Philadelphia Story, which is mixed with
 amaro averna, st. germain, grapefruit, and bitters. It''s smoky, spicy, with a strong
 hint of citrus.
- A subterranean speakeasy for a secret rendezvous. Ring the doorbell by the gold
 sign to gain entry and order the Tiffany cocktail, designed especially for Tiffany
 by Raines Law bartenders.
- Try the Gold Rush. It''s delicious!
- evocative of a different era
- Ring the doorbell - the door is always locked. It''s like Little Branch but even
 sexier. Order the Rumble and kick it in one of the comfy leather chairs.
- buzz into this tucked away speakeasy and you''ll feel like you stepped into someone''s
 (Prohibition-era) living room. Try the refreshing Rumble.
- Perfect ice cubes.
- Check-in before going in. There''s no iPhone reception inside.

- Feeling ambitious? Try getting into the Gramercy Park Hotel''suber-exclusive hangout,
 where Warhols adorn the walls. If you succeed, $19martinis (and bragging rights)
 await you.

- Congratulations, you''ve found one of Esquire''s Best Bars in America. (And congratulations
 again for actually getting in.) We recommend the Maca Martini, made with Sagatiba

 air. Schnabels on the walls, celebs around the fireplace, outrageous cocktails.
 Come before 9pm to secure a table.

 Awesome.
- Get there around 7pm to avoid the reservation policy, and enjoy the $19 martinis
 and Warhol-covered walls.
- Just got the A-list badge here!
